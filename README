An epoll() based event dispatcher for Qt.

Increased performance and lower cpu usage over the default select() based
dispatcher on certain types of applications, such as a server that handles
a lot of concurrent tcp connections.

Usage:
Simply include the header file and define an epoll event dispatcher in main
before creating the Qt application object.

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    QEventDispatcherEpoll epollDispatcher;
    QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);
    ...
    return app.exec();
}
